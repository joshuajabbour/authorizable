A flexible authorization component.

Authorizable is heavily inspired by [Authority](https://github.com/machuga/authority), and works in a similar fashion, but is missing a few key features:

* no alias support for actions
* no automatic current user injection
* altered condition method signature
* some methods have been renamed
